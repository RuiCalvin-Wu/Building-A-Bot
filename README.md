# üß† Build-a-Bot for Entelect Challenge 2025

Welcome to my Build-a-Bot project, created for the **Entelect Challenge 2025**. This bot was developed to compete in the Zooscape game scenario, where autonomous agents (a.k.a. bots) navigate mazes, collect pellets, dodge zookeepers, and maximize their score.
